# Observo-LUA-Scripts
A handy repository of LUA scripts to transform your Event Data! 

NOTE: These scripts should be tested before deployed in production. I will make every effort to updated these as time allowes. Remembe to carefully test each before deploying in production, and if you should encounter challenges or errors, please creat an issue so I can take a look 
- I will need...
1. A sample of your event
2. A copy of the LUA you used
3. A description of the desired end state
4. A description of the issue you experienced
5. Screenshots are also helpful 


## How To Use These Scripts
- Each script is designed to be a universal and flexible as possible. However, in some cases the LUA transform requires data to be in a certain "state" before LUA can effectively target and apply against your events. As such, it is important to test and verify in you IN/OUT data data preview to ensure your output is as expected.
